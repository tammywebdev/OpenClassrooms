This repository contains the projects that I completed and presented to professional assessors.

# Projects

The following projects are listed in the order of time: most recent projects are listed on top, least recent projects are listed further down the list.

## To Do list app

This project is a single page application that can work offline (without internet connectivity) for managing a personal To Do list.

The [To Do list app](https://github.com/tammywebdev/OpenClassrooms/blob/main/projects/todo-list-app/README.md) implements the Model View Controller design pattern using vanilla javascript.

In order to complete this project, I had to take over the app, fix critical bugs, add unit tests, write technical documentation and compare the app's performance against another competitor app.

## Restaurant Review Site

This project is a single page application for searching and rating restaurants interactively on a map UI.

The Restaurant Review Site uses React Js, Google Maps API, React Bootstrap.
