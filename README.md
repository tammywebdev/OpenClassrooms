# About Me

Hi, my name is Tammy. I am a Front-end web developer, specialing in React Javascript ([LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammywebdev/)).
Currently, I am seeking a work opportunity in a remote team to build and maintain web applications.

This repository is a collection of highlight projects that I have developed recently at OpenClassrooms.


# About OpenClassrooms

This repository contains the projects that I completed and presented to professional assessors.

# OpenClassrooms Projects

The following projects are listed in the order of time: most recent projects are listed on top, least recent projects are listed further down the list.

## To Do list app

Live demo: https://todo-list-a-57bf7.web.app/

This project is a single page application that can work offline (without internet connectivity) for managing a personal To Do list.

The [To Do list app](https://github.com/tammywebdev/OpenClassrooms/blob/main/projects/todo-list-app/README.md) implements the Model View Controller design pattern using vanilla javascript.

In order to complete this project, I had to take over the app, fix critical bugs, add unit tests, write technical documentation and compare the app's performance against another competitor app.

## Restaurant Review Site

Live demo: https://restaurant-review-site-d69bd.web.app

This project is a single page application for searching and rating restaurants interactively on a map UI.

The [Restaurant Review Site](https://github.com/tammywebdev/OpenClassrooms/blob/main/projects/restaurant-review-app/README.md) uses React Js, Google Maps API, React Bootstrap.

## Board Game

Live demo: https://board-game-64308.web.app/

This is a browser-based game. It can support 2 players on the same computer to play by turn.

The [Board Game](https://github.com/tammywebdev/OpenClassrooms/blob/main/projects/board-game/README.md) is built with pure (vanilla) javascript without any dependencies. It also uses Twitter Bootstrap for the layout.

# Personal Project

After completing OpenClassrooms projects, I continue to improve my coding skills by building personal projects.

## Link shortener
